## Jamaica Stock Exchange Web Scraper
This is a script to scrape stock price data from the Jamaica Stock Exchange website.

## Motivation
I created this script because I found it difficult and time consuming to navigate the JSE website and find the information that I wanted. I also whated a to use technical analysis tools on the data and the JSE website did not offer that feature.

## Features
This script extracts all the relevant data on equities and bonds traded on the JSE. It thens transform the data into a JSON object and loads it into AWS Dynamo DB and/or MongoDB. From there it can be retrieved and used as the user sees fit. 

I've built a companion react native app to display the data in a way that suit my needs. You can find that app [here](https://github.com/romallen/chart-app).
